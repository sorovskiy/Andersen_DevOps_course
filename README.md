# Briefly about me
I'm Marcel Davletbakov. I live in the city of Kazan.

### The course is interesting to me because:
- The organizers of the course are really interested in training people and the teaching is conducted by people who work as DevOps engineers and have real experience.
- DevOps is a very interesting and developing profession, where many new things will be invented, so that there will be many opportunities for growth and there will be no repetitive routine tasks.
- At the end of the course, you can get a job at Andersen

### What do I expect from the course:
- Most of all, I want to get enough knowledge to get a job at Andersen.
From the first lecture, I learned a little about the company, about its philosophy. I really liked the way people are treated in Andersen, that the company is engaged in training and developing its employees. The employees themselves are in no hurry to change their place of work, which is not typical for IT companies and speaks well of Andersen. For those who just want to get a job, courses are organized, and interns do not need work experience, and Andersen is ready to train interns. Very democratic and noble. After all, the training of IT specialists is a great contribution to IT and to the economics as a whole. I am very encouraged by companies that, in addition to making a profit, set themselves some social goals. It seems that I am not mistaken in this. That's why I really liked your company and would like to work in the Andersen team.
- Get a profession where you can always learn something new and grow.
- And this is exactly the profession where a person is required to communicate and be a member of the team.
